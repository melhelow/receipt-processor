## Experinced Challanges
- I faced some challenges in the beginning to understand the requirements, but after I read the requirements carefully and understand the rules of calculations, I was able to start the project and finish it on time.
- 48 hrs delivery window, I was able to finish the project on time, but I think if I had more time I would have done more testing and more validations.

## Future Development
- I would like to add more validations and more testing to the project.
- better psuedocode.
- I would like to add more features to the project like adding more rules of calculations and more features to the manager to be able to add more points to the customer.
- referance the Points Model to the  Receipt Model.
- get Total points for all customers.
- get Total points for each customer inside the purchase receipt.
